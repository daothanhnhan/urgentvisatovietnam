(2, 'What is Vietnam visa on arrival?', '<p>In addition to the conventional method of obtaining a visa at the <a href=\"https://urgentvisatovietnam.com/vietnam-embassy-consulate-worldwide\">Vietnam Embassy</a>, there is an alternative option known as &quot;<a href=\"https://urgentvisatovietnam.com\">Visa on arrival</a>&quot; to obtain a visa for Vietnam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To obtain this type of visa, you, as the visa applicant, must first submit an online application for a visa approval letter. This letter serves as an official authorization that permits you to board the flight and have your visa stamped upon arrival at the airport in Vietnam. To complete the visa stamping process, you will need to present your Vietnam approval letter, along with your passport (which should be valid for at least 6 months), two passport-sized photos, the Vietnamese visa application form, and the stamping fee to the Immigration Officers at the airport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key contrast between obtaining a visa on arrival versus applying for a visa at a Vietnam Embassy lies in the process of obtaining the visa stamp. With a visa on arrival, the Vietnam Immigration Department issues a visa approval letter that confirms your entry into Vietnam on a specific date, and the visa stamp is affixed to your passport upon arrival at the airport in Vietnam. On the other hand, with a visa application submitted to a Vietnam Embassy, the visa stamp is attached to your passport by the embassy before it is returned to you.</p>\r\n', 1),

For detailed prices for each type of visa, please refer to our <a href=\"https://urgentvisatovietnam.com/vietnam-visa-fees\">Vietnam Visa Fees</a> page.</li>\r\n	<li>The stamping fee refers to the fee paid directly in cash to the Immigration Officer at the Vietnam airport for getting the visa stamped onto your passport. The stamping fee can be paid in various currencies, including USD, AUD, VND, etc., but it is recommended to use USD to avoid any discrepancies in the exchange rate. Currently, the applicable stamping fee is:\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li>25 USD for 1 month or 3-month single entry visa;</li>\r\n		<li>50 USD for multiple entry visa valid for up to 3 months;</li>\r\n		<li>95 USD for multiple entry visa valid for up to 6 months;</li>\r\n		<li>135 USD for a multiple entry visa valid for up to 1 year.</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', 2),

If you are considering a trip to this stunning location, taking approximately 5 minutes to read through this post about the Vietnam visa for Phu Quoc Island would be beneficial.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Do I need a visa to travel to Phu Quoc Island?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If your travel plans in Vietnam only include visiting Phu Quoc Island, you can enjoy a 30-day visa exemption regardless of your nationality. Whether you are a foreigner or a Vietnamese citizen with a foreign passport, you do not need a Vietnam visa if your stay on Phu Quoc Island is for 30 days or less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prerequisites for Exemption from Phu Quoc Visa</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To enter Phu Quoc without a visa, visitors must meet the following requirements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ensure your passport is valid for at least 6 months from your arrival date in Phu Quoc, or renew it before your trip.</li>\r\n	<li>Arrive in Phu Quoc via the Phu Quoc International Airport from an international country. This includes direct, indirect, and layover flights, with Phu Quoc being your final destination along the route. Note that your onward destination can be any country except Vietnam.</li>\r\n	<li>Your stay on the island should be for less than 30 days. You must provide proof of your departure from Phu Quoc within 30 days, such as a return airplane ticket or the departure date of a cruise ship, to receive a &quot;Visa Exemption Stamp.&quot;</li>\r\n	<li>Enter Phu Quoc by sea (ship or cruise) or by air (airplane) rather than via a land border.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is the Appearance of Phu Quoc Visa Exemption?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/image/images/phu%20quoc%20exemption%20stamp.JPG\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Can I enjoy Phu Quoc visa exemption if I enter the island through Tan Son Nhat International Airport without leaving the transit area?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, you can. The Phu Quoc visa exemption also applies to visitors who arrive at other Vietnam International Airports such as Noi Bai Airport (in Hanoi), Tan Son Nhat Airport (in Ho Chi Minh City), etc., and they do not leave the transit area. In other words, if a visitor flies to other international airports in Vietnam and stays in the transit lounge to take another flight to Phu Quoc Island, they are also exempted from obtaining a Vietnam visa. However, it is advisable to check with the airlines to confirm whether you have to leave the Immigration Area (also known as the transit area) upon arriving at Tan Son Nhat International Airport or not to ensure you can enjoy the visa waiver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. My passport is set to expire, so what to do to enjoy Phu Quoc visa-free?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should renew it first prior to traveling to Phu Quoc so as to be eligible for Phu Quoc visa exemption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. I&rsquo;m a backpacker and planning to cross the river border from Laos to Vietnam, and then head to Phu Quoc. Am I exempted from a Vietnam visa for Phu Quoc Island?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, the 30-day visa exemption for Phu Quoc only applies if you travel directly to Phu Quoc by air or sea. If you enter Vietnam through a land/river border, you are considered to be in a different part of Vietnam, and a Vietnam visa is required in this case. Therefore, if you do not apply for a visa, you should not be surprised if you get refused at the border. It is important to ensure you have the appropriate visa before traveling to avoid any issues at the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Can I visit Phu Quoc within 15 days without visa?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong>I am from a country where its citizens are eligible for a 15-day Vietnam Visa exemption. Can I visit Phu Quoc within 15 days without getting a visa?<br />\r\n<strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. Phu Quoc is part of Vietnam and your 15-day exemption is applicable to all parts of Vietnam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. How could I get the 30-day Vietnam Visa exemption for Phu Quoc?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you plan to visit Phu Quoc only and no other place in Vietnam, you are eligible for a 30-day visa waiver specifically for Phu Quoc. Your final destination must be Phu Quoc, and you must depart from Phu Quoc to any foreign country by air within 30 days. Upon arrival in Vietnam, you must present your itinerary to the Immigration officers as proof of your travel plans. This exemption allows you to enjoy your stay in Phu Quoc without the need for a separate visa for this specific visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Vietnam visa for foreigners staying in Vietnam and going to Phu Quoc</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q:</strong>&nbsp;I am in Vietnam now and my Vietnam Visa is about to expire and/or my current Vietnam Visa Exemption is about to expire. Am I eligible for a 30-day Phu Quoc Visa Exemption while I am in Vietnam?<br />\r\n<strong>A:</strong>No, if you are already in Vietnam and your current Vietnam visa or visa exemption is about to expire, you are not eligible for the 30-day Phu Quoc Visa Exemption. This exemption is only applicable to visitors who arrive directly to Phu Quoc from a foreign country. It does not apply to those who are already in Vietnam and wish to extend their stay or change their visa status. If your visa is expiring, you will need to apply for a visa extension or a new visa to continue your stay in Vietnam legally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. How to extend a visa in Phu Quoc?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q:</strong>&nbsp;I entered Phu Quoc using 1-month tourist visa, stayed in for 28 days and now I want to stay in for one more week. I.

(128, '5 Common Mistakes with Vietnam Visa', '\r\nTo assist you in avoiding common errors while applying for a visa on arrival to Vietnam, we have compiled a list of the most frequent mistakes made by our customers. ', '<p>Since its introduction in 2004, Vietnam visa on arrival has emerged as the preferred choice for travelers entering Vietnam by air, owing to its numerous advantages:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Convenience</li>\r\n	<li>Simplicity</li>\r\n	<li>Time and cost-saving</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"/vietnam-emergency-visa\">Last-minute application</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We have listed the most frequent mistakes our customers have made when applying for a visa on arrival to Vietnam to help you avoid.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1 &ndash; No need to register Vietnam visa on arrival beforehand</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a common misconception that you can obtain a visa directly at the Vietnam airport without applying online, similar to other Asian countries like Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, etc. However, this is NOT true. Attempting to do so may lead to delays or cancellations of your flights, or you may find yourself waiting at the airport until the visa is approved. To avoid such inconveniences, it is essential to apply for your visa in advance through the appropriate channels.&nbsp;You will need to apply online for an&nbsp;<a href=\"/how-to-apply-for-vietnam-visa-on-arrival\">approval letter</a> in order to pick up your visa at a Vietnam airport.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2 &ndash; Vietnam Visa on Arrival at the border</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Visa on arrival is exclusively applicable to air travel, which means there is NO option for obtaining a visa on arrival for overland/border crossing or sea/water entry. If you plan to enter Vietnam by means other than air, it is crucial to ensure you have the appropriate visa in advance to avoid any travel disruptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3 &ndash; Spelling/Typo mistakes with application for Vietnam visa on arrival</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One common mistake made by applicants is providing incorrect details in the application form, such as misspelling their full name, passport number, or date of birth. Such errors can lead to entry denial at the departure airport because the information on the &#39;letter of approval&#39; does not match the passport details. To avoid this issue, ensure that you carefully and accurately enter all the required information in the application form. Double-checking before submission is essential to ensure a smooth travel experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4 &ndash; Vietnam visa validity</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a common misconception that the visa validity starts from the date of entry into Vietnam, but that is not accurate. The visa validity begins from the date you provide in advance during the application process, not from your entry date. Therefore, it is essential to have a clear plan of when you intend to enter Vietnam before applying for the visa. For instance, if the letter states that you are allowed to enter and stay in the country for 1 month from September 25th, 2018, you must leave Vietnam on or before October 25th, 2018, regardless of the actual day you arrive in the country. Being aware of this detail will help you plan your trip accordingly and avoid any issues with your visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5 &ndash; Vietnam visa extension</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people think that it is easy to <a href=\"/all-the-information-you-need-to-know-about-vietnam-visa-extension-and-renewal\">extend a visa</a> once they are in Vietnam.While the idea of extending a visa may seem straightforward, the reality is more complex. The process of extending a visa can be both costly and time-consuming. If you anticipate the possibility of needing a longer stay, it is wise to apply for a three-month visa in advance instead of opting for a one-month visa. Doing so can save you money and the hassle of going through the visa extension process later on. Planning ahead and choosing the right visa duration can lead to a smoother and more cost-effective travel experience in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are confident that our list of mistakes related to the Vietnam visa on arrival application process is not exhaustive. There may be other potential errors that applicants should be aware of. Therefore, it is essential to exercise caution and carefully review all the requirements and instructions to ensure a successful and trouble-free visa application.

If you are considering a trip to this stunning location, taking approximately 5 minutes to read through this post about the Vietnam visa for Phu Quoc Island would be beneficial.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Do I need a visa to travel to Phu Quoc Island?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If your travel plans in Vietnam only include visiting Phu Quoc Island, you can enjoy a 30-day visa exemption regardless of your nationality. Whether you are a foreigner or a Vietnamese citizen with a foreign passport, you do not need a Vietnam visa if your stay on Phu Quoc Island is for 30 days or less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prerequisites for Exemption from Phu Quoc Visa</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To enter Phu Quoc without a visa, visitors must meet the following requirements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ensure your passport is valid for at least 6 months from your arrival date in Phu Quoc, or renew it before your trip.</li>\r\n	<li>Arrive in Phu Quoc via the Phu Quoc International Airport from an international country. This includes direct, indirect, and layover flights, with Phu Quoc being your final destination along the route. Note that your onward destination can be any country except Vietnam.</li>\r\n	<li>Your stay on the island should be for less than 30 days. You must provide proof of your departure from Phu Quoc within 30 days, such as a return airplane ticket or the departure date of a cruise ship, to receive a &quot;Visa Exemption Stamp.&quot;</li>\r\n	<li>Enter Phu Quoc by sea (ship or cruise) or by air (airplane) rather than via a land border.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is the Appearance of Phu Quoc Visa Exemption?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/image/images/phu%20quoc%20exemption%20stamp.JPG\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Can I enjoy Phu Quoc visa exemption if I enter the island through Tan Son Nhat International Airport without leaving the transit area?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, you can. The Phu Quoc visa exemption also applies to visitors who arrive at other Vietnam International Airports such as Noi Bai Airport (in Hanoi), Tan Son Nhat Airport (in Ho Chi Minh City), etc., and they do not leave the transit area. In other words, if a visitor flies to other international airports in Vietnam and stays in the transit lounge to take another flight to Phu Quoc Island, they are also exempted from obtaining a Vietnam visa. However, it is advisable to check with the airlines to confirm whether you have to leave the Immigration Area (also known as the transit area) upon arriving at Tan Son Nhat International Airport or not to ensure you can enjoy the visa waiver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. My passport is set to expire, so what to do to enjoy Phu Quoc visa-free?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should renew it first prior to traveling to Phu Quoc so as to be eligible for Phu Quoc visa exemption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. I&rsquo;m a backpacker and planning to cross the river border from Laos to Vietnam, and then head to Phu Quoc. Am I exempted from a Vietnam visa for Phu Quoc Island?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, the 30-day visa exemption for Phu Quoc only applies if you travel directly to Phu Quoc by air or sea. If you enter Vietnam through a land/river border, you are considered to be in a different part of Vietnam, and a Vietnam visa is required in this case. Therefore, if you do not apply for a visa, you should not be surprised if you get refused at the border. It is important to ensure you have the appropriate visa before traveling to avoid any issues at the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Can I visit Phu Quoc within 15 days without visa?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong>I am from a country where its citizens are eligible for a 15-day Vietnam Visa exemption. Can I visit Phu Quoc within 15 days without getting a visa?<br />\r\n<strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. Phu Quoc is part of Vietnam and your 15-day exemption is applicable to all parts of Vietnam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. How could I get the 30-day Vietnam Visa exemption for Phu Quoc?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you plan to visit Phu Quoc only and no other place in Vietnam, you are eligible for a 30-day visa waiver specifically for Phu Quoc. Your final destination must be Phu Quoc, and you must depart from Phu Quoc to any foreign country by air within 30 days. Upon arrival in Vietnam, you must present your itinerary to the Immigration officers as proof of your travel plans. This exemption allows you to enjoy your stay in Phu Quoc without the need for a separate visa for this specific visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Vietnam visa for foreigners staying in Vietnam and going to Phu Quoc</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q:</strong>&nbsp;I am in Vietnam now and my Vietnam Visa is about to expire and/or my current Vietnam Visa Exemption is about to expire. Am I eligible for a 30-day Phu Quoc Visa Exemption while I am in Vietnam?<br />\r\n<strong>A:</strong>No, if you are already in Vietnam and your current Vietnam visa or visa exemption is about to expire, you are not eligible for the 30-day Phu Quoc Visa Exemption. This exemption is only applicable to visitors who arrive directly to Phu Quoc from a foreign country. It does not apply to those who are already in Vietnam and wish to extend their stay or change their visa status.

', '<p>Since its introduction in 2004, Vietnam visa on arrival has emerged as the preferred choice for travelers entering Vietnam by air, owing to its numerous advantages:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Convenience</li>\r\n	<li>Simplicity</li>\r\n	<li>Time and cost-saving</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"/vietnam-emergency-visa\">Last-minute application</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We have listed the most frequent mistakes our customers have made when applying for a visa on arrival to Vietnam to help you avoid.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1 &ndash; No need to register Vietnam visa on arrival beforehand</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a common misconception that you can obtain a visa directly at the Vietnam airport without applying online, similar to other Asian countries like Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, etc. However, this is NOT true. Attempting to do so may lead to delays or cancellations of your flights, or you may find yourself waiting at the airport until the visa is approved. To avoid such inconveniences, it is essential to apply for your visa in advance through the appropriate channels.&nbsp;You will need to apply online for an&nbsp;<a href=\"/how-to-apply-for-vietnam-visa-on-arrival\">approval letter</a> in order to pick up your visa at a Vietnam airport.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2 &ndash; Vietnam Visa on Arrival at the border</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Visa on arrival is exclusively applicable to air travel, which means there is NO option for obtaining a visa on arrival for overland/border crossing or sea/water entry. If you plan to enter Vietnam by means other than air, it is crucial to ensure you have the appropriate visa in advance to avoid any travel disruptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3 &ndash; Spelling/Typo mistakes with application for Vietnam visa on arrival</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One common mistake made by applicants is providing incorrect details in the application form, such as misspelling their full name, passport number, or date of birth. Such errors can lead to entry denial at the departure airport because the information on the &#39;letter of approval&#39; does not match the passport details. To avoid this issue, ensure that you carefully and accurately enter all the required information in the application form. Double-checking before submission is essential to ensure a smooth travel experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4 &ndash; Vietnam visa validity</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a common misconception that the visa validity starts from the date of entry into Vietnam, but that is not accurate. The visa validity begins from the date you provide in advance during the application process, not from your entry date. Therefore, it is essential to have a clear plan of when you intend to enter Vietnam before applying for the visa. For instance, if the letter states that you are allowed to enter and stay in the country for 1 month from September 25th, 2018, you must leave Vietnam on or before October 25th, 2018, regardless of the actual day you arrive in the country. Being aware of this detail will help you plan your trip accordingly and avoid any issues with your visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5 &ndash; Vietnam visa extension</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people think that it is easy to <a href=\"/all-the-information-you-need-to-know-about-vietnam-visa-extension-and-renewal\">extend a visa</a> once they are in Vietnam.While the idea of extending a visa may seem straightforward, the reality is more complex. The process of extending a visa can be both costly and time-consuming. If you anticipate the possibility of needing a longer stay, it is wise to apply for a three-month visa in advance instead of opting for a one-month visa. Doing so can save you money and the hassle of going through the visa extension process later on. Planning ahead and choosing the right visa duration can lead to a smoother and more cost-effective travel experience in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are confident that our list of mistakes related to the Vietnam visa on arrival application process is not exhaustive. There may be other potential errors that applicants should be aware of.

So, just make sure that you make a clear plan of when to enter before ordering a visa to Vietnam. For example: the letter says you are allowed to enter and remain in the country for 1 month from September 25th 2018 - this means you must leave the country on or before October 25th 2018 no matter what day you enter the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5 &ndash; Vietnam visa extension</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people think that it is easy to <a href=\"/all-the-information-you-need-to-know-about-vietnam-visa-extension-and-renewal\">extend a visa</a> once they are in Vietnam.

It was our first trip to Vietnam in September, and we realized the day before departure that we needed a visa to travel. Our flight carrier wouldn&#39;t allow us to board the flight to Vietnam without the pre-approval. However, we managed to catch a domestic flight from Sydney to Darwin, hoping the pre-approval would come through in time for our further flight to Ho Chi Minh city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To our relief, when we landed in Darwin, the pre-approval had arrived in our email accounts, thanks to your office&#39;s prompt coordination with Vietnam immigration on the same day. We are immensely grateful to My UrgentVisaToVietnam for facilitating our entry into Vietnam effortlessly. The regular emails we received at each stage of the visa process from your office provided us with comfort and reassurance about the progress of our pre-approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are more than happy to share the above as a testimonial on your website if desired.

(I plan to lodge a formal complaint with the airline for not informing customers about your service when booking through their website.)</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>We found paying cash at the immigration counter in the airport a bit challenging, as there is no credit facility available.

The reception at HCMC Airport was very kind, and those who handed over their filled-out forms and passports promptly received their Visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our second entry to Vietnam at the border between Cambodia and Vietnam, while traveling by Mekong Express, went smoothly without any issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After having traveled to more than 120 countries, Vietnam proved to be a very easy destination to travel in. The available infrastructure is great, and the cost/quality relation for everything a traveler needs is extraordinary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there were some disappointments along the way. We found that certain experiences did not meet our expectations. For instance, trekking in primary forests and meeting minorities in traditional dresses were not as easily accessible as we anticipated. Additionally, the Halong Bay trip we paid for in Hanoi didn&#39;t meet our expectations as the vessel provided was not as modern and beautiful as shown to us; it was an old broken junk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a positive note, we highly recommend exploring the little river at Mui&nbsp;Ne right after sunrise, entering the riverbed barefoot. It&#39;s a unique and special experience worth cherishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, our trip to Vietnam was wonderful, and we truly appreciate the convenience and reliability of your services.

The processing time offered by UrgentVisaToVietnam is based on the processing time frame provided by the Vietnam Immigration Department (the agency directly handles your Vietnam visa application and issues your visa): 8.30 am &ndash; 10.30 am and 13.30 pm &ndash; 15.00 pm (GMT+7) (except for Saturday, Sunday and national holidays). Under normal circumstances, it takes 3 working days (normal processing) or 1 working (urgent processing), starting immediately if your application and payment are delivered to us within the above-stated time frames OR starting from the next working day/shift otherwise, to return the visa to your registered email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In special cases, additional documents or confirmations may be required and processing time may be longer than usual.

When paying a service fee, except for the visa processing service fee quoted in our website, you are responsible for any additional charges associated with your Bank, no matter what your method of payment is. A payment of service fee is only accepted to be successful when our confirmation titled &ldquo;Notification of Successful Payment&rdquo; is sent to your registered email. We are irresponsible for any situations arising due to unsuccessful payment.<br />\r\nThe stamping fee (only for Visa On Arrival) is the fee you must pay in cash (USD is highly recommended) at the Airport Immigration Counter to get your visa stamped onto your passport. We are not responsible for exceeding the amount resulting from inaccurate exchange rates when you pay in other currencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are also supposed to pay all additional fees if you wish to modify/correct any personal information in the visa which was issued by Vietnam Immigration Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cancellation and Refund Policy</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>For Vietnam Visa Service</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>UrgentVisaToVietnam reserves the right to decline to process your visa application for any reason, including but not limited to incomplete documentation, insufficient processing time, or unusual circumstances.

You will receive a full refund of any fees paid for this particular service. However, if you decide to cancel after payment and the visa status is changed to &ldquo;processing&rdquo; and your visa application information has been sent to Immigration as said above, no refund will be given and the service will be completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Request a Vietnam visa No refund will be given once your visa was approved by the Vietnam Immigration Department and delivered to your email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Request a Vietnam visa No cancellation and no refund will be made in case you decline to get a visa containing incorrect details caused by your mistakes.

The available infrastructure is great, and the cost/quality relation for everything a traveler needs is extraordinary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there were some disappointments along the way. We found that certain experiences did not meet our expectations. For instance, trekking in primary forests and meeting minorities in traditional dresses were not as easily accessible as we anticipated. Additionally, the Halong Bay trip we paid for in Hanoi didn&#39;t meet our expectations as the vessel provided was not as modern and beautiful as shown to us; it was an old broken junk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a positive note, we highly recommend exploring the little river at Mui&nbsp;Ne right after sunrise, entering the riverbed barefoot. It&#39;s a unique and special experience worth cherishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, our trip to Vietnam was wonderful, and we truly appreciate the convenience and reliability of your services.

Besides, there are a bunch of pros you may not know:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Convenience: Skip the hassle of preparing numerous documents and visiting the Embassy in person. With Vietnam Visa on Arrival, you only need to fill out an online application form and obtain a pre-approved visa letter. The actual visa stamp will be provided upon your arrival in Vietnam. The entire process is facilitated easily through a local agency&#39;s support.</li>\r\n	<li>Time-saving: Ideal for those with time constraints, Visa on Arrival eliminates the need to visit the Embassy. It is especially beneficial for emergency situations, as urgent visa applications can be processed in as little as 2 - 3 hours.</li>\r\n	<li>Cost-saving: Save on document preparation fees, postage costs for sending documents, and travel expenses to the Embassy. With Visa on Arrival, you only need to pay a stamping fee at the airport upon your entry to Vietnam.</li>\r\n	<li>Various entry types: Unlike the single-entry limitation of an E-visa, Visa on Arrival offers multiple entries, making it more versatile for travelers with frequent in-and-out trips.</li>\r\n	<li>Eligibility: While E-visa is limited to citizens of 80 countries, Vietnam Visa on Arrival is available to citizens of all nations as long as they enter Vietnam by air. This broader eligibility opens up the option for travelers from around the world.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Cons</strong></u><br />\r\nIn addition to the attractive pros, travelers should also take into account the following cons of a visa-on-arrival when planning their trip to Vietnam.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>No official website: Visa on arrival cannot be directly applied for by foreign individuals, as there is no official government-owned website for this service. Instead, you must involve a Vietnamese visa agency, a third-party entity, to obtain the pre-approved visa letter, as all such agencies are private organizations.</li>\r\n	<li>Queuing at the airport: Getting your visa stamped requires waiting in line at the Visa Application counter in the Arrival Immigration area of the airport. The waiting time typically ranges from 15 to 20 minutes during the low season (May to September) and can extend to 30 minutes to 1 hour during the high season (October to April). This may impact your travel plans.</li>\r\n	<li>Entry/exit checkpoints: Although most Vietnam international airports accept visa on arrival, it&#39;s essential to check if your specific entry/exit checkpoint is applicable (*).</li>\r\n	<li>Pre-approved visa letter: Since the visa approval letter may be issued to a group of foreigners, you might find other travelers&#39; names mentioned in your letter.</li>\r\n	<li>Varied visa fee: The visa-on-arrival process involves two types of fees &ndash; the pre-approved visa letter fee, which varies depending on the agency, and the stamping fee, ranging from USD 25 to 50 based on your visa type (duration of stay, single or multiple entries). Additionally, only cash is accepted for the stamping fee at the arrival port.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>List of 8 Vietnam international airports allowing visa on arrival:</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Noi Bai International Airport (Hanoi)</li>\r\n	<li>Tan Son Nhat International Airport (Ho Chi Minh City)</li>\r\n	<li>Danang International Airport (Danang)</li>\r\n	<li>Cat Bi International Airport (Hai Phong)</li>\r\n	<li>Cam Ranh International Airport (Khanh Hoa)</li>\r\n	<li>Lien Khuong International Airport (Lam Dong)</li>\r\n	<li>Can Tho International Airport (Can Tho)</li>\r\n	<li>Phu Quoc International Airport (Phu Quoc)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Who is eligible?</strong></u><br />\r\nWhile a traditional visa at the Vietnamese Embassy/Consulate is eligible for any citizen in the world, the visa on arrival option is eligible for the following applicants:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Tourists: Foreign tourists joining a Vietnam tour organized by a Vietnam travel agency.</li>\r\n	<li>Business travelers: Foreign citizens traveling to Vietnam for business or commercial purposes.</li>\r\n	<li>Transit travelers: Vietnam is one of many destinations in the applicant&#39;s journey.</li>\r\n	<li>Foreign crew members on ships at Vietnamese seaports, wishing to exit Vietnam through another country&#39;s border gate.</li>\r\n	<li>Foreigners and overseas Vietnamese returning to Vietnam to attend a relative&#39;s funeral or visit seriously ill relatives.</li>\r\n	<li>Foreigners entering Vietnam in urgent cases such as incident handling, rescuing, natural disaster prevention, epidemic prevention, or special requests from a competent Vietnamese agency.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Conditions / Applicable laws</strong></u><br />\r\nWhile citizens from all over the world can apply for a visa on arrival when traveling to Vietnam by air and using one of the 8 designated airports for entry and exit, there are additional conditions that you must adhere to, outlined below:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Foreigners coming from a country without the Vietnam Embassy/Consulate.</li>\r\n	<li>Foreigners residing in other countries and currently not present in Vietnam.</li>\r\n	<li>Foreigners with valid passports having at least 6 months of validity ahead of their intended stay in Vietnam.</li>\r\n	<li>Foreigners arriving in Vietnam by air and utilizing one of the 8 designated international airports that allow visa-on-arrival.</li>\r\n	<li>Those who are not prohibited from entering Vietnam, as specified in Article 21 of the Law on entry, exit, transit, and residence of foreigners in Vietnam.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>How to apply?</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Preparation</strong><br />\r\nTo get ready for a visa on arrival, you need to prepare all the followings:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A hard copy of a pre-approved visa letter approved by the Vietnam Immigration Department.</li>\r\n	<li>A visa application form (entry and exit declaration form) provided by the local visa agency (Form NA1).</li>\r\n	<li>02 photos (4x6 or 3x4, same size, white or plain background, newly taken in 6 months, straight looking, without glasses or scarf) (01 is pasted on the visa application form, 01 is used for presentation if needed).</li>\r\n	<li>A valid passport with a validity of at least 06 months beyond your stay in Vietnam.</li>\r\n	<li>Stamping fee in cash (USD25-50 based on your visa type).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Application</strong><br />\r\nThere are things you need to do in advance of your trip and while being at the arrival port to get a visa.

Foreigners can easily apply for the E-visa through the official e-visa website, make the required payment, and await the outcome. The processing time typically takes 3 to 5 working days, and upon approval, applicants can print the visa directly from the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the E-visa is suitable for various purposes, such as tourism, short business trips, and visiting family, it remains relatively new to citizens worldwide.

The process of obtaining a Vietnam work visa can be a bit complicated, but it&#39;s not impossible. In this article, we&#39;ll provide a step-by-step guide on how to get a Vietnam work visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Step 1: Determine Your Visa Type</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The first step in obtaining a Vietnam work visa is to determine the type of visa that you need. The most common types of Vietnam work visas are the work permit and the temporary residence card. The work permit is a document issued by the Department of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (DoLISA) that allows foreign nationals to legally work in Vietnam for a specific employer and for a limited period. The temporary residence card is a document issued by the Immigration Department that allows foreign nationals to reside and work in Vietnam for an extended period, usually up to two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Step 2: Find a Job in Vietnam</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>To obtain a Vietnam work visa, you&#39;ll need a job offer from a Vietnamese employer. It&#39;s important to find a reputable employer that is willing to sponsor your visa and that can provide you with a work permit or temporary residence card.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Step 3: Prepare Your Documents</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have a job offer, you&#39;ll need to prepare your documents. You&#39;ll need a valid passport with at least six months of validity remaining, a police clearance certificate from your home country, and a health certificate. You&#39;ll also need to meet the qualifications and experience requirements for the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Step 4: Apply for a Work Permit or Temporary Residence Card</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>To apply for a work permit or temporary residence card, you&#39;ll need to submit your documents to the DoLISA or Immigration Department. The application process can be time-consuming and may require the assistance of a professional immigration agent or lawyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Step 5: Obtain a Visa Approval Letter</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Once your work permit or temporary residence card is approved, you&#39;ll need to obtain a visa approval letter from the Vietnam Immigration Department. This letter will allow you to apply for a visa at a Vietnamese embassy or consulate in your home country.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Step 6: Apply for a Visa</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#39;ll need to apply for a visa at a Vietnamese embassy or consulate in your home country. You&#39;ll need to provide your passport, visa approval letter, and other required documents. The embassy or consulate will issue you a visa, which will allow you to enter Vietnam.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Step 7: Complete the Visa Stamping Process</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>When you arrive in Vietnam, you&#39;ll need to complete the visa stamping process at the airport. This involves presenting your visa and passport to the immigration officer, who will stamp your passport with the entry stamp.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How long does it take to get a Vietnam Work Visa?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The length of time it takes to obtain a work visa for Vietnam can vary depending on several factors, such as the type of visa, the processing time of the government agency, and the completeness and accuracy of the documents submitted. However, in general, the process can take several weeks to a few months. For a work permit, the processing time typically takes around 15 working days from the date of submission of the application, but it can take longer in some cases. The employer may need to obtain approval from various authorities, such as the Department of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (DoLISA), the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA), and the People&#39;s Committee in the province where the company is located. For a temporary residence card, the processing time can take around 5-7 working days from the date of submission of the application. However, the actual processing time can vary depending on the workload of the Immigration Department. It&#39;s important to note that the process can be delayed if there are any issues with the submitted documents or if additional documents are required. It&#39;s recommended to consult with a professional immigration agent or lawyer to ensure that all the required documents are complete and accurate before submitting the application. Overall, it&#39;s best to plan ahead and apply for a work visa well in advance of your intended travel date to allow for any potential delays in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Difference between Vietnam Work Visa and Vietnam Business Visa</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Vietnam offers different types of visas for foreign nationals, including work visas and business visas.

It&#39;s also valid for up to 3 months, and you can extend it for an additional 3 months.</li>\r\n	<li>Work Visa: This type of visa is for those who plan to work in Vietnam. It&#39;s valid for up to 1 year, and you can extend it for an additional 3 years.</li>\r\n	<li>Student Visa: This type of visa is for those who plan to study in Vietnam. It&#39;s valid for the duration of your studies, and you can extend it as needed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you know the different types of visas available, let&#39;s explore the options for extending or renewing your Vietnam visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Vietnam Visa Extension</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Applying for a visa extension is a process that enables foreigners to extend their stay in Vietnam without the need to exit the country. Once approved, an extension stamp will be added to their passport, indicating their new authorized stay duration. It&#39;s worth noting that a visa extension is only valid for single entry purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Vietnam Visa Renewal</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Visa renewal and visa extension share similarities as both options enable foreigners to extend their stay in Vietnam without the requirement to leave the country.<br />\r\nIn contrast to visa extension, visa renewal involves obtaining a new visa sticker and stay duration stamp on the passport, reflecting the updated duration permission. As a result, the visa renewal fee is typically higher than the visa extension fee, as it includes both the stamping fee and visa sticker fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Visa Extension/Renewal Requirements</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To extend/review your Vietnam visa, your original passport must:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Be valid for at least 06 months from the time of extension/renewal.</li>\r\n	<li>Have at least 02 blank pages.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>What are the reasons to opt for a visa extension?</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The only choice is to continue remaining in Vietnam legally after your visa expiry date without leaving the country</li>\r\n	<li>Save your cost as the extension fee is much cheaper than the renewal fee.</li>\r\n	<li>Avoid being taken into the blacklist of the Vietnam Immigration Department because of overstaying.</li>\r\n	<li>Have more time to settle your business in Vietnam which might be interrupted if you leave Vietnam and then come back with a new visa.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Where to Extend Visa in Vietnam?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Hanoi immigration office: 44-46 Tran Phu, Ba Dinh District, Hanoi<br />\r\nImmigration office in Da Nang: 78 Le Loi, Thach Thang, Hai Chau, Da Nang<br />\r\nImmigration office in Ho Chi Minh City: 196 Nguyen Thi Minh Khai, Ward 6, District 3, Ho Chi Minh city<br />\r\nWorking hours: Monday-Friday (Morning: 7am &ndash; 11h30am; Afternoon: 1h30pm &ndash; 5pm) and Saturday (Morning time only)</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to extend Vietnam visa?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two options for obtaining a visa extension: applying directly at the Vietnam Immigration Department, or utilizing our Vietnam visa extension service for a more convenient process.<br />\r\nIf you choose to utilize our<a href=\"/all-the-information-you-need-to-know-about-vietnam-visa-extension-and-renewal\"> visa extension service</a>, the process of successfully extending your visa can be achieved in just three simple steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Send us a soft copy of your passport and the page containing your current Vietnam visa and we will inform you whether your visa can be extended or not</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Send your original passport to our address and pay the extension fee</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Get your passport with extended stay within 8 working days normally or 3 working days in urgent case upon your request</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Vietnam Visa Extension Cost and Duration</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The visa extension in Vietnam can be applied for the types of visas below:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Extend original visa exemption for up to 1 month</li>\r\n	<li>Extend original 1-month tourist visa for 1 month</li>\r\n	<li>Extend the original 1-month business visa for up to 3 months</li>\r\n	<li>Extend original 3 months tourist visa for 1 month;</li>\r\n	<li>Extend the original 3 months business visa for up to 3 months</li>\r\n	<li>Extend the original 5 years visa exemption certificate for up to 6 months</li>\r\n	<li>Extend original e-visa for up to 3 months</li>\r\n	<li>Extend 1-year tourist visa for US passport holders (tourist/business) for 1 month</li>\r\n	<li>Extend 1-year business visa for US passport holders for up to 3 months</li>\r\n	<li>Extend the temporary stay of APEC Business Travel Card holders for up to 3 months</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em><strong>Disclaimers:</strong> </em>Despite our efforts to maintain accurate and current information, it is possible that there might be changes of which we are unaware.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n', 'vietnam visa extension-6.JPG', '0', 1, '', '2023-04-10', '2023-08-04', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'All the information you need to know about Vietnam visa extension and renewal', 'If you\'re planning a trip to Vietnam, you\'ll need a valid visa to enter the country.

Therefore, when the employment contract terminates, the resident card is either canceled or retrieved by the company at the request of the Immigration Office. Consequently, the foreign worker no longer has a valid Vietnam Resident Card/Visa to continue staying and working in Vietnam unless they are employed by another company.&nbsp;In this case, you must inquire the sponsored company to submit an exit Vietnam visa at the Immigration Office of Vietnam so that he/she can leave Vietnam with a visa legitimately.</li>\r\n	<li>Foreigners who obtain new passports issued within Vietnam.&nbsp;In numerous cases, foreign travelers enter Vietnam with a valid Vietnam visa, but during their stay in the country, they need to obtain a new passport due to the expiration of their current passport with no additional pages for visas.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to apply for a Vietnam exit visa?</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Infants born in Vietnam hold foreign passports.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Document required:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;Child&rsquo;s original passport&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;Birth certificate/ Notice of birth from the hospital</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;Parent(s)&rsquo;s original passport&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steps</strong>: You can seek the assistance of any visa agency in Vietnam to obtain a Vietnam exit visa.

Tourist visa</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Vietnam Tourist visa, classified as DL, is the most prevalent visa type for travelers. With this visa, you can typically stay in Vietnam for 15 to 30 days for each single entry, and it is extendable beyond the initial duration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are four ways to apply for a Tourist visa:</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Visa on arrival</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>For the most convenient option, if you are flying to Vietnam, you can apply for a Visa on Arrival. Follow these steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Apply online for an approval letter at least 3-5 days before your flight through <a href=\"https://urgentvisatovietnam.com/step-1\" target=\"_new\">https://urgentvisatovietnam.com/step-1</a>.</li>\r\n	<li>Print the approval letter.</li>\r\n	<li>Upon arrival at the airport in Vietnam, present the approval letter along with two passport-sized photos and your valid passport to get your visa stamped.</li>\r\n	<li>The stamping fee ranges from USD 25 to USD 50, depending on the number of entries, and must be paid in cash.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Visa at embassy</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You can submit your visa application directly to the Embassy if you are near their office. The fee and documents required may vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>E-visa</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>For a single-entry visit lasting up to 30 days, you can apply for an E-visa online. This option is available to citizens of 80 nationalities. Follow these steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Visit Vietnam&#39;s National Portal on Immigration at https://www.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/ to begin the application process.</li>\r\n	<li>Upload your scanned passport and passport photo separately, and fill in the required information.</li>\r\n	<li>Pay the application fee of 25 USD to submit your application.</li>\r\n	<li>Save the registration code provided for future reference and to check the status of your application at https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/tra-cuu-ho-so later.</li>\r\n	<li>Once approved, you can print your E-visa for your travel to Vietnam.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to save time, let a travel agency process the visa application for you and pay the additional service fee.

Business visa</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are visiting Vietnam for business purposes, the ideal visa type is the business visa, categorized as DN1 and DN2. The DN1 visa is issued when you visit Vietnam to work with a company or organization that has legal status in Vietnam. On the other hand, the DN2 visa is issued if you provide services or goods in Vietnam with your own commercial presence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding validity and number of entries, there are several types of Vietnam Business visas available, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>1 entry in 1 month</li>\r\n	<li>Multiple entries in 1 month</li>\r\n	<li>1 entry in 3 months</li>\r\n	<li>Multiple entries in 3 months</li>\r\n	<li>Multiple entries in 6 months</li>\r\n	<li>Multiple entries in 1 year</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The duration of your stay in Vietnam plays a role in the ease of obtaining your Business visa. For shorter stays, it is generally easier to obtain the visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three common ways to apply for this type of visa:</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Visa on arrival</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like the Tourist visa, the Business visa can also be obtained upon arrival at an international airport in Vietnam. Follow these steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Apply online for an approval letter at least 3-5 days in advance through <a href=\"https://urgentvisatovietnam.com/step-1\" target=\"_new\">https://urgentvisatovietnam.com/step-1</a>.</li>\r\n	<li>Print the approval letter.</li>\r\n	<li>Upon your arrival at the airport in Vietnam, present the approval letter along with two passport-sized photos and your valid passport to get your visa stamped.</li>\r\n	<li>The stamping fee, to be paid in cash, may vary from USD 25 to USD 130 depending on the validity and number of entries granted in your visa.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Visa at embassy</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also go to an Embassy/Consulate and follow their instructions to submit your application. The fee may vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Work visa</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Labor visa is designed for foreigners working in Vietnam for a company. It offers a validity of up to 1 year and can be extended for up to 10 years after obtaining an LD temporary residence card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two types of Labor visas, represented by LD1 and LD2. If you possess a certificate of work permit exemption, you can apply for LD1. Otherwise, you must provide a work permit to apply for LD2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To obtain a Labor visa, you need the employer company in Vietnam to acquire an LD visa approval letter on your behalf. Depending on the type of approval letter obtained, you can either apply for your Labor visa at the nearest Vietnam Embassy/Consulate or receive it upon your arrival. There will be visa approval application and visa stamping fees to be paid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eligibility for the Labor visa requires you to have a minimum of 3 years of working experience in an executive or senior position, a valid work contract, and evidence that the employer has advertised the recruitment in a newspaper or online platform but was unable to find a suitable candidate locally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have both a work permit and a work permit exemption certificate, consider getting a Business visa first. Once your work permit is issued, you can apply for a Labor visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Investor Visa</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Categorized as DT, Vietnam Investor visa is issued to foreigners who go to Vietnam to invest in a business in Vietnam. Depending on the length of validity and capital contribution, there are 4 types of Investor visa:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The DT1 visa is granted to investors who contribute at least VND 100 billion (~ USD4,253,510) and is valid for 10 years.</li>\r\n	<li>The DT2 visa is granted to investors who contribute VND 50 billion - VND 100 billion (~ USD 2,126,755 - USD 4,253,510) and is valid for 5 years.</li>\r\n	<li>The DT3 is granted to investors who contribute VND 03 billion - VND 50 billion (~ USD 127,605.3 - USD 2,126,755) and is valid for 3 years.</li>\r\n	<li>The DT4 visa is granted to investors who contribute up to VND 03 billion (~ USD 127,605.3) and is valid for 1 year.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>DT1, DT2 and DT3 are extendable with a temporary residence card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to apply for an Investor visa, before you fly to Vietnam, prepare your valid passport and acquire a Visa Approval Letter with these required documents:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>(1) Enterprise or Investment Registration Certificate (certified copy) for the Vietnam-based company you plan to invest in.</li>\r\n	<li>(2) Temporary residence form</li>\r\n	<li>(3) Form NA16,</li>\r\n	<li>(4) Form NA5 and</li>\r\n	<li>(5) Form NA2 with Barcode.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The process for obtaining the Investor visa may take approximately 5 working days. Once you receive the approval letter, you can proceed with the following options:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Option 1: If you plan to apply for the visa at a Vietnam Embassy/Consulate, bring the approval letter, two 4x6cm photos, your passport, and Form NA5. Submit these documents on the scheduled date to receive your Investor visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Option 2: Alternatively, if you prefer Visa on Arrival, present the approval letter, photos, passport, and Form N1 at the airport upon your arrival. The visa stamping fee will vary from USD 25 to USD 50, depending on the number of entries and the validity period.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Visa for Visiting Family (Dependant visa)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Vietnam Dependent visa, represented as TT, is designed for foreigners who wish to visit their relatives and stay in Vietnam for a duration of up to 12 months. You are eligible for this visa if your husband/wife/parent/child is a Vietnamese citizen. If your relative is a foreigner holding a LV2, LS, DT1, DT2, DT3, NN1, NN2, DH, PV1, LD1, or LD2 visa, the validity of your TT visa will be at least 30 days shorter than their passport validity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For applicants who are over 18 years old and have a foreign guarantor, the TT visa is valid for no more than 6 months. If you wish to continue staying in Vietnam after your TT visa expires, you can apply for a Dependent residence card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To obtain your TT visa, your Vietnamese relative will be responsible for most of the process. The required documents for them to prepare include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Form NA3 (to request your entry permit as a dependent, if you have not arrived in Vietnam yet) or Form NA5 (to apply for your visa/visa extension, if you are already in Vietnam).</li>\r\n	<li>A certified copy of their ID card and household registration book.</li>\r\n	<li>Relevant certificates to demonstrate the legal relationship between you and your relative (such as marriage certificate, birth certificate, etc.).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Otherwise, he/she is to prepare:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Form NA2 (to apply for your dependent visa, if you have not arrived in Vietnam yet) or Form NA5 (to apply for your visa/visa extension, if you are already staying in Vietnam).</li>\r\n	<li>Your original passport (in case you are already staying in Vietnam).</li>\r\n	<li>His/her passport and visa/residence card.</li>\r\n	<li>Relevant certificates to prove the legal relationship between you and your relative (such as marriage certificate, birth certificate, etc.).</li>\r\n	<li>An introduction letter requesting him/her to process your visa application on your behalf at the Vietnam Immigration Department.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Once your Vietnamese relative submits these documents to the Immigration office in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, they can expect to receive the result within 5 business days.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Student visa</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Vietnam Student visa, represented as DH, is intended for foreigners who come to Vietnam for studying purposes. Its validity is usually at least 30 days less than your passport&#39;s validity, typically not exceeding 12 months, but it can be extended for up to 1 year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Student visas are commonly applied for after arriving in Vietnam. You can initially obtain a Tourist visa to enter Vietnam and then enroll in your desired course. Afterward, you can apply for a visa status change at the Vietnam Immigration Department. Along with a valid passport, you will need to provide a written acceptance letter from the school, and there must be an organization in Vietnam to serve as your guarantor. The visa cost may range from USD 35 to USD 145, depending on the duration of validity and number of entries. If you plan to return to your home country and come back to Vietnam frequently, it is advisable to choose a multiple entry visa. However, using an agency to apply for this type of visa on your behalf may be more straightforward than doing it independently. The service fee and processing time may vary accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, Vietnam offers various types of visas to suit different purposes. Hopefully, the information above assists you in determining your ideal visa type and makes the process of obtaining it more manageable.</p>\r\n', 'vietnam visa types.JPG', '0', 2, 'Advise me on Vietnam Visa Types', '2023-04-21', '2023-08-04', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Vietnam Visa Types', 'As per the updated immigration regulations in effect from July 1, 2020 (Law No. 51/2019/QH14), Vietnam visas are now categorized into approximately 21 main types based on the purpose of the visit.

Check full list <a href=\"/vietnam-evisa-eligible-countries\">here</a>.<br />\r\nHowever, a business e-visa is good for 30 days in single entry only, and it cannot be extended without leaving Vietnam. As such, in case you wish to stay in Vietnam longer than 30 days, you are highly recommended to get the business visa through one of the other two options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Applying for a Vietnam Business evisa personally</strong><br />\r\nTo apply for a Business Visa online, as you are completing the online application form at the Vietnam Immigration Portal, simply select &ldquo;Business Activities&rdquo; as the purpose of your travel on the dropdown menu.<br />\r\nThen, upload a picture of yourself, a scanned picture of your passport, pay the visa fee, and wait for the visa to be processed.<br />\r\nIf your Vietnam Business e-visa application is approved, you can download the visa and present it at the entry checkpoint of Vietnam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The inviting organization/company applies for your Vietnam Business eVisa</strong><br />\r\nIf the company you will join is going to apply for your Business Visa, they have to register on the Vietnam Immigration Portal, where they will be provided with an account and an electronic signature.<br />\r\nThey have to upload a scanned picture of your passport, your pictures, and pay the visa fee.<br />\r\nIf their application is approved, they have to send you the registration code so that you can print out your evisa and enter Vietnam.<br />\r\nThis evisa process often takes you or your sponsor 3 working days to complete, or longer depending on the volume of visa applications pending for processing.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>In case you find the process complicated, or need to get your visa urgently, feel free to let us know. We can help you to get it in 1 &ndash; 2 &ndash; 3 working days.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>[submit]</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Can I extend a Vietnam Business Visa?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The embassy visa and visa on arrival can be extended in Vietnam while the e-visa cannot.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Vietnam Business Visa Price</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The fee for a Vietnam Business Visa depends on the method through which you&rsquo;re applying:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>If you are applying for a Vietnam Business Visa On Arrival:\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li>Single-entry, 1 month: USD 25</li>\r\n		<li>Multiple-entry, 1 month USD 50</li>\r\n		<li>Single-entry, 3 months USD 25</li>\r\n		<li>Multiple-entry, 3 months USD 50</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>If you are applying for a Vietnam Business eVisa: USD 25</li>\r\n	<li>If you are applying for a Vietnam Business Visa at an Embassy/Consulate: It depends on the specific Embassy or Consulate.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>*In case you get the embassy visa/VOA, you and your sponsor will need to pay certain charges for the sponsorship letter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please be informed that we can involve in the process to help you get your business visa EASILY &amp; QUICKLY.

However, the process of obtaining a work permit in Vietnam can be daunting, especially for those unfamiliar with the country&#39;s regulations and procedures.<br />\r\nIn this article, we will guide you through the process of obtaining a work permit in Vietnam, covering everything from eligibility requirements to application procedures and common mistakes to avoid. So, whether you&#39;re a business owner looking to employ foreign talent or an individual seeking employment opportunities in Vietnam, read on to learn everything you need to know about obtaining a work permit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Eligibility Requirements for Vietnam Work Permit</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreigners who wish to work in Vietnam are required to obtain a work permit, with few exceptions. The eligibility criteria for a work permit in Vietnam are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The foreigner must be 18 years or older.</li>\r\n	<li>The foreigner must have a valid passport with at least six months of validity remaining.</li>\r\n	<li>The foreigner must be healthy and not suffer from any contagious diseases.</li>\r\n	<li>The foreigner must have no criminal record or any record of violation of Vietnamese law.</li>\r\n	<li>The foreigner must have a job offer from a Vietnamese company or organization.</li>\r\n	<li>The foreigner must meet the qualifications and requirements for the job.</li>\r\n	<li>Application Procedures for Vietnam Work Permit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The process of obtaining a work permit in Vietnam can be time-consuming, so it&#39;s important to start the application process as early as possible. Here are the steps to follow:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 1: Apply for a Work Permit Application Form</strong><br />\r\nThe first step in the application process is to obtain a work permit application form.

Besides, there are a bunch of pros you may not know:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Convenience: Skip the hassle of preparing numerous documents and visiting the Embassy in person. With Vietnam Visa on Arrival, you only need to fill out an online application form and obtain a pre-approved visa letter. The actual visa stamp will be provided upon your arrival in Vietnam. The entire process is facilitated easily through a local agency&#39;s support.</li>\r\n	<li>Time-saving: Ideal for those with time constraints, Visa on Arrival eliminates the need to visit the Embassy. It is especially beneficial for emergency situations, as urgent visa applications can be processed in as little as 2 - 3 hours.</li>\r\n	<li>Cost-saving: Save on document preparation fees, postage costs for sending documents, and travel expenses to the Embassy. With Visa on Arrival, you only need to pay a stamping fee at the airport upon your entry to Vietnam.</li>\r\n	<li>Various entry types: Unlike the single-entry limitation of an E-visa, Visa on Arrival offers multiple entries, making it more versatile for travelers with frequent in-and-out trips.</li>\r\n	<li>Eligibility: While E-visa is limited to citizens of 80 countries, Vietnam Visa on Arrival is available to citizens of all nations as long as they enter Vietnam by air. This broader eligibility opens up the option for travelers from around the world.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Cons</strong></u><br />\r\nIn addition to the attractive pros, travelers should also take into account the following cons of a visa-on-arrival when planning their trip to Vietnam.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>No official website: Visa on arrival cannot be directly applied for by foreign individuals, as there is no official government-owned website for this service. Instead, you must involve a Vietnamese visa agency, a third-party entity, to obtain the pre-approved visa letter, as all such agencies are private organizations.</li>\r\n	<li>Queuing at the airport: Getting your visa stamped requires waiting in line at the Visa Application counter in the Arrival Immigration area of the airport. The waiting time typically ranges from 15 to 20 minutes during the low season (May to September) and can extend to 30 minutes to 1 hour during the high season (October to April). This may impact your travel plans.</li>\r\n	<li>Entry/exit checkpoints: Although most Vietnam international airports accept visa on arrival, it&#39;s essential to check if your specific entry/exit checkpoint is applicable (*).</li>\r\n	<li>Pre-approved visa letter: Since the visa approval letter may be issued to a group of foreigners, you might find other travelers&#39; names mentioned in your letter.</li>\r\n	<li>Varied visa fee: The visa-on-arrival process involves two types of fees &ndash; the pre-approved visa letter fee, which varies depending on the agency, and the stamping fee, ranging from USD 25 to 50 based on your visa type (duration of stay, single or multiple entries). Additionally, only cash is accepted for the stamping fee at the arrival port.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>List of 8 Vietnam international airports allowing visa on arrival:</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Noi Bai International Airport (Hanoi)</li>\r\n	<li>Tan Son Nhat International Airport (Ho Chi Minh City)</li>\r\n	<li>Danang International Airport (Danang)</li>\r\n	<li>Cat Bi International Airport (Hai Phong)</li>\r\n	<li>Cam Ranh International Airport (Khanh Hoa)</li>\r\n	<li>Lien Khuong International Airport (Lam Dong)</li>\r\n	<li>Can Tho International Airport (Can Tho)</li>\r\n	<li>Phu Quoc International Airport (Phu Quoc)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Who is eligible?</strong></u><br />\r\nWhile a traditional visa at the Vietnamese Embassy/Consulate is eligible for any citizen in the world, the visa on arrival option is eligible for the following applicants:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Tourists: Foreign tourists joining a Vietnam tour organized by a Vietnam travel agency.</li>\r\n	<li>Business travelers: Foreign citizens traveling to Vietnam for business or commercial purposes.</li>\r\n	<li>Transit travelers: Vietnam is one of many destinations in the applicant&#39;s journey.</li>\r\n	<li>Foreign crew members on ships at Vietnamese seaports, wishing to exit Vietnam through another country&#39;s border gate.</li>\r\n	<li>Foreigners and overseas Vietnamese returning to Vietnam to attend a relative&#39;s funeral or visit seriously ill relatives.</li>\r\n	<li>Foreigners entering Vietnam in urgent cases such as incident handling, rescuing, natural disaster prevention, epidemic prevention, or special requests from a competent Vietnamese agency.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Conditions / Applicable laws</strong></u><br />\r\nWhile citizens from all over the world can apply for a visa on arrival when traveling to Vietnam by air and using one of the 8 designated airports for entry and exit, there are additional conditions that you must adhere to, outlined below:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Foreigners coming from a country without the Vietnam Embassy/Consulate.</li>\r\n	<li>Foreigners residing in other countries and currently not present in Vietnam.</li>\r\n	<li>Foreigners with valid passports having at least 6 months of validity ahead of their intended stay in Vietnam.</li>\r\n	<li>Foreigners arriving in Vietnam by air and utilizing one of the 8 designated international airports that allow visa-on-arrival.</li>\r\n	<li>Those who are not prohibited from entering Vietnam, as specified in Article 21 of the Law on entry, exit, transit, and residence of foreigners in Vietnam.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>How to apply?</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Preparation</strong><br />\r\nTo get ready for a visa on arrival, you need to prepare all the followings:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A hard copy of a pre-approved visa letter approved by the Vietnam Immigration Department.</li>\r\n	<li>A visa application form (entry and exit declaration form) provided by the local visa agency (Form NA1).</li>\r\n	<li>02 photos (4x6 or 3x4, same size, white or plain background, newly taken in 6 months, straight looking, without glasses or scarf) (01 is pasted on the visa application form, 01 is used for presentation if needed).</li>\r\n	<li>A valid passport with a validity of at least 06 months beyond your stay in Vietnam.</li>\r\n	<li>Stamping fee in cash (USD25-50 based on your visa type).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Application</strong><br />\r\nThere are things you need to do in advance of your trip and while being at the arrival port to get a visa.

Foreigners can easily apply for the E-visa through the official e-visa website, make the required payment, and await the outcome. The processing time typically takes 3 to 5 working days, and upon approval, applicants can print the visa directly from the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the E-visa is suitable for various purposes, such as tourism, short business trips, and visiting family, it remains relatively new to citizens worldwide. Presently, Vietnam supports online visa issuance for citizens of 80 countries across the globe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>E-visa in brief</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>Year of introduction</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>2017 (February)</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>Eligible countries</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>80 countries (initially 46)</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>Number of entry ports</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>33 (8 airports, 16 landports and 9 seaports)</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>Fee (gov&nbsp;fees)</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>25 USD</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>Processing time</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>3-5 working days</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>Official website</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>https://immigration.gov.vn</p>\r\n\r\n			<p>This is the only official website, do not get misled by fake official websites.</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>E-visa validity</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>30 days, single entry only</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>Upcoming proposal</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>Prolonged to 3 month (single/multiple entry)</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who is eligible for the Vietnam eVisa?</h2>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>As per the Vietnam Immigration Department, Vietnam has introduced a pilot program for E-visa issuance, extending this option to citizens from 80 countries.

You only need to follow step-by-step instructions and provide the necessary information on the website.</li>\r\n	<li>Time and cost-saving: Avoid the hassle and expenses of traveling back and forth to the Vietnam Embassy. With E-visa, you can easily process your application from the comfort of your own home, saving time, money, and energy.</li>\r\n	<li>Easy follow-up: Your E-visa application will be associated with a registration code.

If you plan to stay longer, you&#39;ll need to opt for another type of visa.</li>\r\n	<li>Entry time: E-visa permits single-entry only. If you need to enter Vietnam multiple times for business or other purposes, this visa option is not suitable.</li>\r\n	<li>High accuracy requirement: The approval of the visa relies entirely on the information provided during the application process. If any information is incorrect or insufficient, you cannot amend it after submission. Moreover, the application fee is non-refundable if the application gets rejected.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To avoid any visa-related issues during your trip to Vietnam, it is essential to plan accordingly.

The process of obtaining a Vietnam work visa can be a bit complicated, but it&#39;s not impossible. In this article, we&#39;ll provide a step-by-step guide on how to get a Vietnam work visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Step 1: Determine Your Visa Type</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The first step in obtaining a Vietnam work visa is to determine the type of visa that you need. The most common types of Vietnam work visas are the work permit and the temporary residence card. The work permit is a document issued by the Department of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (DoLISA) that allows foreign nationals to legally work in Vietnam for a specific employer and for a limited period. The temporary residence card is a document issued by the Immigration Department that allows foreign nationals to reside and work in Vietnam for an extended period, usually up to two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Step 2: Find a Job in Vietnam</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>To obtain a Vietnam work visa, you&#39;ll need a job offer from a Vietnamese employer. It&#39;s important to find a reputable employer that is willing to sponsor your visa and that can provide you with a work permit or temporary residence card.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Step 3: Prepare Your Documents</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have a job offer, you&#39;ll need to prepare your documents. You&#39;ll need a valid passport with at least six months of validity remaining, a police clearance certificate from your home country, and a health certificate. You&#39;ll also need to meet the qualifications and experience requirements for the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Step 4: Apply for a Work Permit or Temporary Residence Card</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>To apply for a work permit or temporary residence card, you&#39;ll need to submit your documents to the DoLISA or Immigration Department. The application process can be time-consuming and may require the assistance of a professional immigration agent or lawyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Step 5: Obtain a Visa Approval Letter</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Once your work permit or temporary residence card is approved, you&#39;ll need to obtain a visa approval letter from the Vietnam Immigration Department. This letter will allow you to apply for a visa at a Vietnamese embassy or consulate in your home country.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Step 6: Apply for a Visa</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#39;ll need to apply for a visa at a Vietnamese embassy or consulate in your home country. You&#39;ll need to provide your passport, visa approval letter, and other required documents. The embassy or consulate will issue you a visa, which will allow you to enter Vietnam.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Step 7: Complete the Visa Stamping Process</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>When you arrive in Vietnam, you&#39;ll need to complete the visa stamping process at the airport. This involves presenting your visa and passport to the immigration officer, who will stamp your passport with the entry stamp.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How long does it take to get a Vietnam Work Visa?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The length of time it takes to obtain a work visa for Vietnam can vary depending on several factors, such as the type of visa, the processing time of the government agency, and the completeness and accuracy of the documents submitted. However, in general, the process can take several weeks to a few months. For a work permit, the processing time typically takes around 15 working days from the date of submission of the application, but it can take longer in some cases. The employer may need to obtain approval from various authorities, such as the Department of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (DoLISA), the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA), and the People&#39;s Committee in the province where the company is located. For a temporary residence card, the processing time can take around 5-7 working days from the date of submission of the application. However, the actual processing time can vary depending on the workload of the Immigration Department. It&#39;s important to note that the process can be delayed if there are any issues with the submitted documents or if additional documents are required. It&#39;s recommended to consult with a professional immigration agent or lawyer to ensure that all the required documents are complete and accurate before submitting the application. Overall, it&#39;s best to plan ahead and apply for a work visa well in advance of your intended travel date to allow for any potential delays in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Difference between Vietnam Work Visa and Vietnam Business Visa</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Vietnam offers different types of visas for foreign nationals, including work visas and business visas.

Tourist visa</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Vietnam Tourist visa, classified as DL, is the most prevalent visa type for travelers. With this visa, you can typically stay in Vietnam for 15 to 30 days for each single entry, and it is extendable beyond the initial duration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are four ways to apply for a Tourist visa:</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Visa on arrival</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>For the most convenient option, if you are flying to Vietnam, you can apply for a Visa on Arrival. Follow these steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Apply online for an approval letter at least 3-5 days before your flight through <a href=\"https://urgentvisatovietnam.com/step-1\" target=\"_new\">https://urgentvisatovietnam.com/step-1</a>.</li>\r\n	<li>Print the approval letter.</li>\r\n	<li>Upon arrival at the airport in Vietnam, present the approval letter along with two passport-sized photos and your valid passport to get your visa stamped.</li>\r\n	<li>The stamping fee ranges from USD 25 to USD 50, depending on the number of entries, and must be paid in cash.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Visa at embassy</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You can submit your visa application directly to the Embassy if you are near their office. The fee and documents required may vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>E-visa</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>For a single-entry visit lasting up to 30 days, you can apply for an E-visa online. This option is available to citizens of 80 nationalities. Follow these steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Visit Vietnam&#39;s National Portal on Immigration at https://www.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/ to begin the application process.</li>\r\n	<li>Upload your scanned passport and passport photo separately, and fill in the required information.</li>\r\n	<li>Pay the application fee of 25 USD to submit your application.</li>\r\n	<li>Save the registration code provided for future reference and to check the status of your application at https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/tra-cuu-ho-so later.</li>\r\n	<li>Once approved, you can print your E-visa for your travel to Vietnam.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to save time, let a travel agency process the visa application for you and pay the additional service fee. Apply online for an evisa&nbsp;at <a href=\"https://urgentvisatovietnam.com/step-1\">https://urgentvisatovietnam.com/step-1</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Business visa</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are visiting Vietnam for business purposes, the ideal visa type is the business visa, categorized as DN1 and DN2. The DN1 visa is issued when you visit Vietnam to work with a company or organization that has legal status in Vietnam. On the other hand, the DN2 visa is issued if you provide services or goods in Vietnam with your own commercial presence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding validity and number of entries, there are several types of Vietnam Business visas available, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>1 entry in 1 month</li>\r\n	<li>Multiple entries in 1 month</li>\r\n	<li>1 entry in 3 months</li>\r\n	<li>Multiple entries in 3 months</li>\r\n	<li>Multiple entries in 6 months</li>\r\n	<li>Multiple entries in 1 year</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The duration of your stay in Vietnam plays a role in the ease of obtaining your Business visa. For shorter stays, it is generally easier to obtain the visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three common ways to apply for this type of visa:</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Visa on arrival</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like the Tourist visa, the Business visa can also be obtained upon arrival at an international airport in Vietnam. Follow these steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Apply online for an approval letter at least 3-5 days in advance through <a href=\"https://urgentvisatovietnam.com/step-1\" target=\"_new\">https://urgentvisatovietnam.com/step-1</a>.</li>\r\n	<li>Print the approval letter.</li>\r\n	<li>Upon your arrival at the airport in Vietnam, present the approval letter along with two passport-sized photos and your valid passport to get your visa stamped.</li>\r\n	<li>The stamping fee, to be paid in cash, may vary from USD 25 to USD 130 depending on the validity and number of entries granted in your visa.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Visa at embassy</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also go to an Embassy/Consulate and follow their instructions to submit your application. The fee may vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Work visa</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Labor visa is designed for foreigners working in Vietnam for a company. It offers a validity of up to 1 year and can be extended for up to 10 years after obtaining an LD temporary residence card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two types of Labor visas, represented by LD1 and LD2. If you possess a certificate of work permit exemption, you can apply for LD1. Otherwise, you must provide a work permit to apply for LD2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To obtain a Labor visa, you need the employer company in Vietnam to acquire an LD visa approval letter on your behalf. Depending on the type of approval letter obtained, you can either apply for your Labor visa at the nearest Vietnam Embassy/Consulate or receive it upon your arrival. There will be visa approval application and visa stamping fees to be paid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eligibility for the Labor visa requires you to have a minimum of 3 years of working experience in an executive or senior position, a valid work contract, and evidence that the employer has advertised the recruitment in a newspaper or online platform but was unable to find a suitable candidate locally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have both a work permit and a work permit exemption certificate, consider getting a Business visa first. Once your work permit is issued, you can apply for a Labor visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Investor Visa</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Categorized as DT, Vietnam Investor visa is issued to foreigners who go to Vietnam to invest in a business in Vietnam. Depending on the length of validity and capital contribution, there are 4 types of Investor visa:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The DT1 visa is granted to investors who contribute at least VND 100 billion (~ USD4,253,510) and is valid for 10 years.</li>\r\n	<li>The DT2 visa is granted to investors who contribute VND 50 billion - VND 100 billion (~ USD 2,126,755 - USD 4,253,510) and is valid for 5 years.</li>\r\n	<li>The DT3 is granted to investors who contribute VND 03 billion - VND 50 billion (~ USD 127,605.3 - USD 2,126,755) and is valid for 3 years.</li>\r\n	<li>The DT4 visa is granted to investors who contribute up to VND 03 billion (~ USD 127,605.3) and is valid for 1 year.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>DT1, DT2 and DT3 are extendable with a temporary residence card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to apply for an Investor visa, before you fly to Vietnam, prepare your valid passport and acquire a Visa Approval Letter with these required documents:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>(1) Enterprise or Investment Registration Certificate (certified copy) for the Vietnam-based company you plan to invest in.</li>\r\n	<li>(2) Temporary residence form</li>\r\n	<li>(3) Form NA16,</li>\r\n	<li>(4) Form NA5 and</li>\r\n	<li>(5) Form NA2 with Barcode.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The process for obtaining the Investor visa may take approximately 5 working days. Once you receive the approval letter, you can proceed with the following options:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Option 1: If you plan to apply for the visa at a Vietnam Embassy/Consulate, bring the approval letter, two 4x6cm photos, your passport, and Form NA5. Submit these documents on the scheduled date to receive your Investor visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Option 2: Alternatively, if you prefer Visa on Arrival, present the approval letter, photos, passport, and Form N1 at the airport upon your arrival. The visa stamping fee will vary from USD 25 to USD 50, depending on the number of entries and the validity period.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Visa for Visiting Family (Dependant visa)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Vietnam Dependent visa, represented as TT, is designed for foreigners who wish to visit their relatives and stay in Vietnam for a duration of up to 12 months. You are eligible for this visa if your husband/wife/parent/child is a Vietnamese citizen. If your relative is a foreigner holding a LV2, LS, DT1, DT2, DT3, NN1, NN2, DH, PV1, LD1, or LD2 visa, the validity of your TT visa will be at least 30 days shorter than their passport validity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For applicants who are over 18 years old and have a foreign guarantor, the TT visa is valid for no more than 6 months. If you wish to continue staying in Vietnam after your TT visa expires, you can apply for a Dependent residence card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To obtain your TT visa, your Vietnamese relative will be responsible for most of the process. The required documents for them to prepare include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Form NA3 (to request your entry permit as a dependent, if you have not arrived in Vietnam yet) or Form NA5 (to apply for your visa/visa extension, if you are already in Vietnam).</li>\r\n	<li>A certified copy of their ID card and household registration book.</li>\r\n	<li>Relevant certificates to demonstrate the legal relationship between you and your relative (such as marriage certificate, birth certificate, etc.).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Otherwise, he/she is to prepare:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Form NA2 (to apply for your dependent visa, if you have not arrived in Vietnam yet) or Form NA5 (to apply for your visa/visa extension, if you are already staying in Vietnam).</li>\r\n	<li>Your original passport (in case you are already staying in Vietnam).</li>\r\n	<li>His/her passport and visa/residence card.</li>\r\n	<li>Relevant certificates to prove the legal relationship between you and your relative (such as marriage certificate, birth certificate, etc.).</li>\r\n	<li>An introduction letter requesting him/her to process your visa application on your behalf at the Vietnam Immigration Department.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Once your Vietnamese relative submits these documents to the Immigration office in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, they can expect to receive the result within 5 business days.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Student visa</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Vietnam Student visa, represented as DH, is intended for foreigners who come to Vietnam for studying purposes. Its validity is usually at least 30 days less than your passport&#39;s validity, typically not exceeding 12 months, but it can be extended for up to 1 year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Student visas are commonly applied for after arriving in Vietnam. You can initially obtain a Tourist visa to enter Vietnam and then enroll in your desired course. Afterward, you can apply for a visa status change at the Vietnam Immigration Department. Along with a valid passport, you will need to provide a written acceptance letter from the school, and there must be an organization in Vietnam to serve as your guarantor. The visa cost may range from USD 35 to USD 145, depending on the duration of validity and number of entries. If you plan to return to your home country and come back to Vietnam frequently, it is advisable to choose a multiple entry visa. However, using an agency to apply for this type of visa on your behalf may be more straightforward than doing it independently. The service fee and processing time may vary accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, Vietnam offers various types of visas to suit different purposes. Hopefully, the information above assists you in determining your ideal visa type and makes the process of obtaining it more manageable.</p>\r\n', NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Vietnam Visa Types', 'As per the updated immigration regulations in effect from July 1, 2020 (Law No. 51/2019/QH14), Vietnam visas are now categorized into approximately 21 main types based on the purpose of the visit.
